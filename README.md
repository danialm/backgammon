Please see a working version of the game [here](https://danialm.github.io/backgammon/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The Backgammon is a React client application. It makes request to the [Backgammon Api](https://danialm.github.io/backgammon-api/).

For now you need to set the serverUrl in [confing](https://github.com/danialm/backgammon/blob/master/src/js/config.js) to local server if you want to run the Backgammon API locally.

To run:
```
$ npm start
```

To build:
```
$ npm build
```
